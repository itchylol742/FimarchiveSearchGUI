Anyway, you may find out more about the Tentalicus Hentailidae on Derpibooru, although bear in mind Phantim prefers to work with anthros, whereas I went with standard pony form for this fic. I've also taken a few liberties here and there, since I need to overthink <i>everything</i> I do. Even porn.</p><p>The first chapter is standalone. I marked it as incomplete because I <i>really</i> liked working on this, and there <i>is</i> material for a continuation.</p>", "id": 409894, "num_chapters": 1, "num_comments": 34, "num_dislikes": 19, "num_likes": 231, "num_views": 3099, "num_words": 7495, "prequel": null, "published": true, "rating": 92, "short_description": "Rainbow falls into the clutches of a surprisingly intimate tentacle monster.", "status": "visible", "submitted": true, "tags": [{"id": 7, "name": "Rainbow Dash", "old_id": "c:8", "type": "character", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/rainbow-dash"}, {"id": 6, "name": "Twilight Sparkle", "old_id": "c:7", "type": "character", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/twilight-sparkle"}, {"id": 328, "name": "Porn", "old_id": "", "type": "genre", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/porn"}, {"id": 120, "name": "Romance", "old_id": "g:romance", "type": "genre", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/romance"}, {"id": 4, "name": "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic", "old_id": "", "type": "series", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/mlp-fim"}, {"id": 126, "name": "Sex", "old_id": "t:sex", "type": "warning", "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/tag/sex"}], "title": "Courtship and Breeding Habits of the Tentalicus Hentailidae", "total_num_views": 3099, "url": "https://www.fimfiction.net/story/409894/courtship-and-breeding-habits-of-the-tentalicus-hentailidae"},

While she drinks lots of fluids to avoid dehydration, she doesn't want to stop for bathroom breaks. Rarity alternates between trying to convince her to take a break and accept her friends' help, and trying to impress Trenderhoof. Can Applejack go through the harvest without having an accident? And if she can't, will it make Trenderhoof any less infatuated with her? How far is Rarity willing to go to win him over?</p><p>Contains: <span class=\"spoiler\">Wetting, messing, farts, sweat, and soap/washing</span>. Anyone who quite understandably finds these disgusting, turn back and read something that doesn't disgust you.</p><p>This is an EqG, fetish-based parody of the episodes &quot;Applebuck Season&quot; and &quot;Simple Ways&quot;. I can't remember if they specified how harvesting apples goes in EqG, and it PROBABLY isn't by kicking the trees, so if anything contradicts what we know, consider this AU. And as usual, don't take too seriously or expect super-great writing. And if you dislike the fetishes in this story, please DON'T associate the episodes too deeply with it, I'd hate to ruin the show for anyone with my fantasies.</p>", "id": 410098, "num_chapters": 1, "num_comments": 6, "num_dislikes": 14, "num_likes": 11, "num_views": 188, "num_words": 3040, "prequel": null, "published": true, "rating": 44, "short_description": "Applejack refuses to accept help or take bathroom breaks at Applebuck Season.

Will revealing her past help her understand more of herself and find a place in this new future?</p><hr/><p>During her travels all over Equestria, Crystal Note runs into all kinds of ponies. Some of those ponies grew into friends, a few even turn into family.<br/>However, each new travel means leaving those friends. Thankfully, there are ways to stay in touch nonetheless.</p><p>These are the letters Crystal Note sent and received during her travels, from finding a place where she belongs through her years as a travelling musician and after.</p><hr/><p>Welcome to this little side story from the Crystal Note AU.
